# zhasher

zhasher is a library for handling hash tables in C.  It is intended as a drop-in two-file library that takes little work to setup and teardown, and even less work to integrate into a project of your own.


## Installation

To keep things simple, there will probably never be an official package for this.  zhasher will build on any Unix based platform with whatever compiler you choose.

zhasher can be built with: 
	`gcc -Wall -Werror -std=c99 zhasher.c main.c`


## Usage
